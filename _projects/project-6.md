This is a special project at National Applied Research Laboratories - Chip Implementation Center (CIC). In this project, I went through the complete process of designing a chip: pre-sim, defining layout, design rule checking (DRC), layout versus schematic (LVS), and post-sim. In the end, I designed a Rail-to-Rail Input/Output Operational Amplifier. The chip has been successfully taped out using UMC 180nm CMOS Technology.
