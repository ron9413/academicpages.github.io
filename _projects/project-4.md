This is a special project on reinforcement learning with Professor Hung-Yi Lee at National Taiwan University. We built a strong agent for Bomberman by combining supervised learning from human games, and reinforcement learning (DQN) from self-play games. Here is the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwVctbCRPA4).
