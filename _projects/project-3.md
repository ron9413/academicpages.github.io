This is a course project of Electrical Engineering Lab - Digital Circuit at National Taiwan University. We designed a wireless auto-sensing robot with FPGA-based controller. It can explore unknown environments and construct real-time maps. Please see the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cLKUaGpkVY&feature=youtu.be).
