This is a course project of Machine Learning at National Taiwan University. It's a Kaggle competition with 380 teams. In this competition, the titles, text, and tags of Stack Exchange questions from six different sites (biology, cooking, crypto, diy, robotics, travel) are provided. The task is to predict tags on unseen **physics** questions. Our team is in the top 25% of this competition.
