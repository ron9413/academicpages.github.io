This is a special project on data analytics with Professor Chung-Yang Ric Huang at National Taiwan University. We crawled NBA data collected over the past 35 years from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and used MySQL and Tableu to analyze and visualize advanced NBA statistics. Here is our [slides](https://ron9413.github.io/files/NBA_Analysis.pptx).
