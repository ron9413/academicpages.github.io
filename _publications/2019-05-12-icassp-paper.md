## Abstract
3D reconstruction, inferring 3D shape information from a single 2D image, has drawn attention from learning and vision communities. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning pose-aware 3D shape reconstruction. Our proposed model learns deep representation for recovering the 3D object, with the ability to extract camera pose information but without any direct supervision of ground truth camera pose. This is realized by exploitation of 2D-3D self-consistency between 2D masks and 3D voxels. Experiments qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model, which performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.
