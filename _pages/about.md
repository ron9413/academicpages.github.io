I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computational Data Science through the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in Machine Learning and its application, especially on Natural Language Processing, Speech Processing and Computer Vision. Previously, I worked on spoken dialog systems under [Professor Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/), and 3D object reconstruction under [Professor Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html).

Here is my [CV](https://ron9413.github.io/files/cv-pin-jung.pdf).
