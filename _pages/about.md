I am currently an undergraduate student finishing my final year at National Taiwan University. My research interests lie in Deep Learning and its application, especially on Natural Language Processing, Speech Processing and Computer Vision. I worked on spoken dialog systems under [Professor Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/), and 3D object reconstruction under [Professor Yu-Chiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html).

Here is my [CV](https://ron9413.github.io/files/cv-pin-jung.pdf).
